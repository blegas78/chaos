# Usage for Chaos - TLOU2:

## Game difficulty:

Please choose any difficulty except full grounded and any permadeath setting.  For grounded difficulty, choose custom and set all but one to grounded.  This is needed since full grounded or permadeath will disable the ability to enable cheats.  I recommend dropping "Resources" to Moderate so that you can craft mollies/smoke bombs to have some modifiers make sense.

It is also recommended to play a New Game + for chaos though it is not necessary.

## General Usage:

The Chaos Engine can be paused with any press of the Options Button.  The only way to resume the Chaos Engine is to press the Share Button.  The Share Button is disabled from invoking the Playstation share features.  

During a Chaos pause, all controller inputs (except for the Share button) are sent like normal, granting you full control of your Playstation as normal.  Generally when you need to do things like navigate your PS main menu, you will want Chaos to be paused.

Chaos is intended to be run only when you have control of your character.  If you do not have control of a character, then simply pause Chaos.  This happens in some cases automatically like when you skip a cutscene.  Performing a skip cutscene should occur like normal, and you can continue to skip other cutscenes if needed.  Only resume Chaos when you have regained control of your character.

During tough battles with ridiculous control schemes, you will die very frequently.  Do your best to pause Chaos immediately when you see the death cutscene.  Like before, only resume when you have regained character control.



## Menu setup:
Be sure to have unlocked all Gameplay Modifiers and Render Modes in the Extras menu.  Each option must be unlocked individually.  This will require a full playthrough of the game to unlock.

The menu must be set up in a particular way to that Chaos can navigate and enable/disable options.  The last hovered-over settings will persist, so you will need to make sure to back out of the menu in a proper way to that the persisted options are the ones that Chaos expects.

The simple rule for chaos is that the top-most option must be hovered over in every menu screen before backing out to a prior menu.

Before each run of chaos you will need to enter the game menu manually and ensure that most options are set to default.  The only exceptions to these are options invovling things like your aim settings and audio settings.  

Here is an example of setting the Gameplay Modifiers and Render Modes to defaults:

Press the Options button
- Navigate to "Extras"
- - Select "Gameplay Modifiers"
- - - Press Triangle to reset all options (make sure that all cheats are purchased)
- - - hover over the top selection "Mirror World"
- - - Press Circle to back out
- - Select "Render Modes"
- - - Press Triangle to reset all options (make sure that all modes are purchased)
- - - Hover over "None"
- - - Press Circle to back out
- - Make sure to hover over "Render Modes"
- - Press Circle to back out
- Either press Options or Circle to exit the pause menu.

When you have control of the character, press the Share button to resume Chaos.


This similar process must also be performed in all of the submenus within "Options" in the main pause menu.  


## Tips:

You can certainly play Chaos however you like, though I think it is fun to try your best to get through encounters even though the control scheme feels nearly impossible.  Now is a great time to improvise and try out new strats!  If some sections were simple run-through sections, now treat them as a kill-all to really see how you handle crazy scenarios.

If you know that you are about to enter a new area where you lose control of your character or if you want to craft something, take a look over at the StreamerInterface window to see how much time you have until the next mod kicks in.  If you only have a few seconds, wait until the new mod comes in.  This will let modifiers like Desk Pop, Throw Molly, etc. actually work.
