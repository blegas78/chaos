# Usage for Chaos - TLOU2:

## Game difficulty:

Please choose any difficulty except full grounded.  For grounded difficulty, choose custom and set all but one to grounded.  This is needed since full grounded will disable the ability to enable cheats.  I recommend dropping "Resources" to Moderate so that you can craft mollies/smoke bombs to have some modifiers make sense.


## General Usage:

The Chaos Engine can be paused with any press of the Options Button.  The only way to resume the Chaos Engine is to press the Share Button.  The Share Button is disabled from invoking the more Playstation share features.  

During a Chaos pause, all controller inputs (except for the Share button) are sent like normal, granting you full control of your Playstation as normal.  Generally when you need to do things like navigate your PS main menu, you will want Chaos to be paused.

Chaos is intended to be run only when you have control of your character.  If you do not have control of a character, then simply pause Chaos.  This happens in some cases automatically like when you skip a cutscene.  Performing a skip cutscene should occur like normal, and you can continue to skip other cutscenes if needed.  Only resume Chaos when you have regained control of your character.

During tough battles with ridiculous control schemes, you will die very frequently.  Do your best to pause Chaos immediately when you see the death cutscene.  Like before, only resume when you have regained character control.



## Menu setup:
The menu must be set up in a particular way to that Chaos can navigate and enable/disable options.  The last selected settings will persist, so you will need to make sure to back out of the menu in a proper way to that the persisted options are the ones that Chaos expects.

The simple rule for chaos meaning is that the top-most option must be selected in every screen before backing out to a prior menu.

## Tips:
You can pull up a web browser and navigate to your Raspberry Pi (like you did during setup) and click on "ActiveMods", so that you can be aware of the timing of things and know what's currently active.  I think that Chaos is more fun when you don't know what modifiers to expect, so I recommend not looking at the "Votes" page or your OBS layout when playing.

You can certainly play Chaos however you like, though I think it is fun to try your best to get through encounters even though the control scheme feels nearly impossible.  Now is a great time to improvise and try out new strats!  If some sections were simple run-through sections, now treat them as a kill-all to really see how you handle crazy scenarios.

If you know that you are about to enter a new area where you lose control of your character ro if you want to craft something, take a look over at the ActiveMods window to see how much time you have until the next mod kicks in.  If you only have a few seconds, wait until the new mod comes in.  This will let modifiers like Desk Pop, Throw Molly, etc. actually work.
